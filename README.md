# Next.js 15 Server Components: Race Condition with Deeply Nested Dynamic Imports

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition issue in Next.js 15 when using server components with deeply nested dynamic imports. The problem occurs when a nested client component attempts to import a module that depends on another dynamically imported module higher up in the component tree. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if the dependent module isn't loaded before it's accessed.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.  Observe the potential error or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the asynchronous loading of modules and ensuring that dependencies are resolved before they're accessed.  This can be achieved by using promises or async/await to coordinate the loading of modules and using appropriate loading states to handle asynchronous operations gracefully.
